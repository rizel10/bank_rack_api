# bank_rack_api

## Getting started

This project uses bundler

```ruby
gem install bundler
```
Then run `bundle install`

Create a config/database.yml file (there is an example at config folder)

Next, run this task to set things up:

```console
$ rake db:prepare
```

This will run all migrations and populate the database with one test user.

### Navigating through the api

I Used Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) to navigate and perform tests on the API.

Here is the Postman [Collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/a50aab55b0d7e4196500)

And published Postman [Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/630023/bank-rack/6taZ4tG)
